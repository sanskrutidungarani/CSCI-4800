Prototype Deliverable: README

Overview
Our prototype, eAnywhere, addresses a critical issue in education: the high cost and limited accessibility of EdTech tools for students, especially those from lower socioeconomic backgrounds. By creating a platform that combines free educational resources with online and offline functionality, we aim to bridge the digital divide and ensure equitable learning opportunities for all.


Tools and Requirements
To run this prototype, you will need:
- Tool/Platform: Figma 
- System Requirements: Internet connection for online access; compatible browser such as Chrome or Safari.

Known Limitations
- Feature Incompleteness:
  Language and localization can be an issue, the prototype only supports a single language, limiting accessibility for non-native speakers or international users.
  Limited educational content can be an issue, the platform may not yet have a comprehensive library of free resources for all subjects or educational levels, requiring users to have get external materials.
  Performance on low-end devices can be an issue, users with older or low-performance devices may experience a slower load times or reduced interactivity, especially with resource-heavy features.
- Compatibility:
  The platform is optimized for mobile browsers; desktop functionality is limited and will be improved in future updates.
